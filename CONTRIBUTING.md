## Contributing to Soundcork

Welcome!  We welcome contributions to help make this software more robust
work for wider community of people.

### Code of Conduct

Everyone participating in our issue tracker, pull requests, and chat, is
expected to treat other people with respect and more generally to follow the
guidelines articulated in the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Communication

Right now, the only communication with the maintainers is via
Github. If it turns out enough people want to contribute to this to justify
having another communication method, we will set  one up. For now, use
[Github Issues](https://github.com/deborahgu/soundcork/issues).

### State of the Code

This is currently pre-alpha code which we are releasing for testers.  We are
running on Python 3.12 on Ubuntu 24.04 (noble).  If somebody wants to make it
run on other environments (e.g. on a RaspberryPi or Arduino, or via a Dockerfile)
we welcome contributions or documentation modifications.

This is currently extremely undertested.

Pay attention to [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) when deploying or modifying..


### First time contributors

If you're looking for things to help with, browse the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/deborahgu/soundcork/issues).

At this time, most of the issues are still written for the maintainers,
and they are  extremely minimally written. If you pick up an issue and there's
not enough information there to know what the actual requirements are or the
problem statement is, just ask.

You do not need to ask for permission to work on any of these issues.
Just fix the issue yourself, try to add a unit test and
open a pull request.

### Submitting changes

We accept pull requests on Github.  One of the maintainers will merge and review
your pull request when they think it's ready.

For nontrivial fixes, we highly recommend opening an issue before you start
writing code.  That way, there can be a discussion in case the maintainers have
disagreements or ideas, before you start work.

If your change will be a significant amount of work to write, we highly
recommend starting by opening an issue laying out what you want to do.  That
lets a conversation happen early in case other contributors disagree with what
you'd like to do or have ideas that will help you do it.

The best pull requests have comments to clearly describe their purpose,
explain why this code has the right solution, and contain tests.
