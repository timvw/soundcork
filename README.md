# SoundCork

Keep your Bose SoundTouch speaker fully functional after Bose shuts down the SoundTouch cloud servers on May 6, 2026.

SoundCork is a self-hosted replacement for the four Bose cloud servers that SoundTouch speakers depend on. It serves all responses locally — no traffic to Bose, no risk of unwanted firmware updates, no data leaving your network.

Fork of [deborahgu/soundcork](https://github.com/deborahgu/soundcork) with added Docker support, smart proxy mode, and deployment guides.

### Service status

We'll maintain a forum post with the [Current Status of Bose Cloud Services](https://github.com/deborahgu/soundcork/discussions/181). Check there for updates. We will update whenever we learn new information.

## What Works

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| TuneIn radio presets | Working | Presets 1-6, station playback |
| Spotify Connect | Working | Cast from the Spotify app — independent of Bose servers |
| Spotify presets | Working | Requires a [one-time kick-start](docs/spotify.md#fixing-spotify-presets) via Spotify Connect |
| Web UI | Working | Browser-based speaker control at `/webui/` |
| SSO/OIDC authentication | Working | Optional — works with any OIDC provider (Authentik, Keycloak, Auth0, etc.) |
| AUX input | Working | Not affected by shutdown |
| Bluetooth | Working | Not affected by shutdown |
| Firmware updates | Blocked | SoundCork returns "no updates available" |
| SoundTouch app presets | Not working | App can no longer configure TuneIn presets — use [Bose CLI](https://github.com/timvw/bose) instead |

## Quick Start

```bash
docker run -d --name soundcork \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ./data:/soundcork/data \
  -e base_url=http://your-server:8000 \
  -e data_dir=/soundcork/data \
  ghcr.io/timvw/soundcork:main
```

Verify it's running:
```bash
curl http://your-server:8000/
# {"Bose":"Can't Brick Us"}
```

Then open `http://your-server:8000/webui/` to access the Web UI.

The container image supports `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (Raspberry Pi).

See [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md) for Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and bare metal options.

## Setup

1. **Get SSH access** to your speaker — [Speaker Setup Guide](docs/speaker-setup.md#step-1-enable-ssh-access)
2. **Extract your speaker data** (presets, sources, device info) — [Speaker Setup Guide](docs/speaker-setup.md#step-2-extract-speaker-data)
3. **Deploy SoundCork** on your network — [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md)
4. **Redirect your speaker** to SoundCork — [Speaker Setup Guide](docs/speaker-setup.md#step-3-redirect-speaker-to-soundcork)

## Authentication

The Web UI is protected by session-based authentication. By default it uses a username/password login (configured via `MGMT_USERNAME`/`MGMT_PASSWORD`).

Optionally, you can enable **SSO via any OpenID Connect provider** (Authentik, Keycloak, Auth0, Google, Okta, etc.):

```bash
docker run -d --name soundcork \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ./data:/soundcork/data \
  -e base_url=http://your-server:8000 \
  -e data_dir=/soundcork/data \
  -e OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://your-provider/application/o/soundcork/ \
  -e OIDC_CLIENT_ID=soundcork \
  -e OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret \
  ghcr.io/timvw/soundcork:main
```

When OIDC is configured, the login page shows a "Sign in with SSO" button. When it's not configured, the password form is shown. See [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md#authentication) for details.

## How It Works

SoundTouch speakers communicate with four Bose cloud servers. SoundCork replaces all of them by editing the speaker's configuration to point to your server instead.

See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for details on the Bose servers, operating modes, and data flows.

## Bose CLI

The official SoundTouch app can no longer configure presets pointing to TuneIn stations. The [Bose CLI](https://github.com/timvw/bose) talks directly to the speaker's local API (port 8090) and works independently of any cloud server:

```bash
brew install timvw/tap/bose
bose preset    # view presets
bose status    # speaker status
bose volume 30 # set volume
```
