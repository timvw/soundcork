## Security in Soundcork

Soundcork is written to be run in your own network. Although you could
put up a version of this server for public use by everyone with a
compatible device,  we have not put any security into the API.

There is a lot of work that would need to happen to make this secure to
run in a public network, including, but not limited to:

- authenticated calls
- data sanitization
- connecting to the speakers
